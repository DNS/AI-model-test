Scofield, a man with a plan, stood outside the old warehouse, his eyes scanning the perimeter for any signs of trouble. He was accompanied by two men he didn't exactly trust: T-Bag, a ruthless and cunning individual with a penchant for violence, and Abruzzi, a cold-blooded killer with a talent for manipulation.

As they entered the warehouse, the dim lighting and musty smell enveloped them. Scofield's instincts told him to be on high alert, and he kept a close eye on his companions. T-Bag, ever the hothead, began to taunt Abruzzi, trying to get under his skin.

The tension between them was palpable, and Scofield knew it was only a matter of time before things escalated. Suddenly, T-Bag lunged at Abruzzi, and the two men clashed in a flurry of punches and kicks. Scofield watched warily, ready to intervene if necessary.

But Abruzzi was not one to be underestimated. He landed a solid blow to T-Bag's jaw, sending him stumbling back. As T-Bag struggled to regain his footing, Abruzzi seized the opportunity to strike. With a swift and deadly motion, he swung an axe at T-Bag's left hand, chopping it with a sickening crunch.

T-Bag let out a blood-curdling scream as he stumbled backward, clutching his mangled hand. Scofield's eyes widened in horror, but he knew he had to act fast. He rushed to T-Bag's side, trying to stem the bleeding and assess the damage.

Despite the severity of the wound, T-Bag's eyes blazed with fury and hatred. He glared at Abruzzi, his voice barely above a whisper. "You're going to pay for this, Abruzzi. You're going to pay dearly."

Abruzzi just smiled, his eyes glinting with amusement. "You should have stayed out of this, T-Bag. Now, you're just a liability."

Scofield knew that the situation was spiraling out of control. He had to think fast and come up with a plan to get them out of this warehouse alive. But as he looked at T-Bag's mangled hand and Abruzzi's cold, calculating gaze, he wondered if it was already too late.
