Scofield had been on the run for months. With nothing to lose, he decided it was time to finally face his foes head-on: T-Bag and Abruzzi - two men who were always one step ahead of him in their criminal undertakings within Las VegasΓÇÖ seedy underworld. The plan? A daring breakout from the city's maximum security prison, where Scofield had spent years as a prisoner for his past misdeeds and was now hoping to make amends by putting an end once and for all to this menace that plagued him - T-Bag and Abruzzi.

The two hitmen were notorious in the criminal community, each specializing in their unique skills; one with a deadly gun armor while the other was skilled at psychological warfare ΓÇô but despite these differences, they shared an unyielding hatred towards Scofield and would stop at nothing to silence him. They knew he had something that could make them pay dearly - information about their next big score in Las Vegas' criminal underworld.

As the sun set on another sleepless night within those cold, gray walls of the prison, a plan began forming inside ScofieldΓÇÖs head ΓÇô one involving his escape and an old acquaintance who had just arrived as well; T-Bag was coming to town for what appeared to be business. And then there was Abruzzi, another powerful figure whose presence in Las Vegas couldn't be ignored by anyone within the criminal world - not even Scofield himself with his newfound determination and resolve ΓÇô two of their biggest enemies; each bringing a unique threat that needed to be neutralized once and for all.

Scofield knew he had little time before they would find out about his escape, but tonight was going to change everything as planned. With the help of an inside job orchestrated by one sympathetic guard, Scofield managed to slip away from prison during a chaotic riot outside and made quick work for himself in exiting through a secret tunnel that led straight into T-Bag's private garage - unbeknownst even to Abruzzi who was waiting nearby.

Upon his arrival, Scofield immediately sensed the tension between him and these men ΓÇô an understanding passed on from years of shared animosity made it clear they were not pleased with this sudden intrusion into their territory; but he knew that if time wasnΓÇÖt granted for diplomacy here tonight, things could quickly spiral out of control. He had barely gotten his foot inside the garage door before T-Bag and Abruzzi stormed in together ΓÇô a display meant to instill fear at Scofield's mere presence but also serve as a tactical move: if he knew who was planning on attacking, it might give him an upper hand.

The two hitmen wereted no time confronting their rival intruder once inside the garage; however before any of that could happen, Abruzzi lunged at T-Bag and engaged in a fierce struggle with his formidable adversary while Scofield observed from the shadows ΓÇô he couldnΓÇÖt afford to let them kill each other just yet as this was all part of their plan. With swift movements honed by years within these dark alleys, Abruzzi managed to deliver one brutal blow which left T-Bag's hand severely injured and bleeding profusely; but despite the wound that threatened his life should he be incapacitated for any longer than necessary ΓÇô Scofield refused defeat.

Without missing a beat, he lunged into action himself as well - fighting back against Abruzzi with all his might while continuously dodging blows from T-Bag who was still trying to defend himself despite the damage done; they fought in close quarters within this confined space, but Scofield knew that if things went on without resolution tonight ΓÇô he would be next.

The fight raged as both opponents were evenly matched - with a mix of fists and knuckle power thrown against each other across the concrete floors; it was clear they weren't going down anytime soon, but Scofield had one last trick up his sleeve that would put an end to this once-and-for-all. As if on cue ΓÇô without warning or hesitation - he retrieved a concealed ax from beneath the garage floorboards and held it out with both hands as Abruzzi continued delivering blows, relentless in his desire for revenge against Scofield but unaware of how this would all end.

A single swing was enough to strike fear into everyone's heart; however not even the most violent criminals were immune from their own follies ΓÇô as T-Bag stepped forward with a handgun that had seen better days, he attempted an assault on Scofield - but fate intervened in its cruelest form when his gun accidentally discharged. It fired blindly into darkness without targeting anyone specific and instead struck Abruzzi right below the chin where it hit close to vital organs ΓÇô instantly ending life as we know it within that garage, with just Scofield left standing; both enemies now lay motionless on the ground in their own blood.

In an unexpected turn of events, T-Bag had been disarmed and also laid out - but he wasn't dead yet from his gunshot wound ΓÇô instead lying unconscious atop a pile of rubble that was once part of this very garage where the fight took place; it appeared as though some outside force or intervention played its hand in these events, one might even say divine.

With no time to spare and knowing well enough than things can quickly escalate from here on out ΓÇô Scofield knew he had little choice but take matters into his own hands once more - this time not just for personal reasons anymore but as a means of protecting the innocent lives within Las Vegas' criminal underworld.

As dawn approached and light started to fill these dark corners, it was clear that tonight would be one which had changed everything; with both T-Bag and Abruzzi now incapacitated - their reigns as menaces were over ΓÇô Scofield felt a weight lifted off his shoulders he never knew could exist. For the first time since becoming an outlaw years ago, peace was within reach once more for those who called Las Vegas home; it seemed like tomorrow might just be another chance at life - one filled with hope and possibilities that had been lost too many times before tonight's fateful encounter inside T-BagΓÇÖd garage.
