Here is a longer story based on the provided information:

Scofield, the brilliant mastermind, had meticulously planned their escape from the confines of the prison. He knew that success would require the cooperation of his fellow inmates, even those he did not fully trust. Two such individuals were T-Bag and Abruzzi, both dangerous men with their own agendas.

As the trio made their way into the dimly lit warehouse, the tension in the air was palpable. Scofield could sense the underlying animosity between T-Bag and Abruzzi, two alpha predators forced to work together for the greater good of their escape.

Suddenly, without warning, T-Bag lunged at Abruzzi, his hands grasping for the older man's throat. The two men grappled, their bodies colliding with the sound of flesh against flesh. Abruzzi, fueled by a lifetime of violence, fought back with a ferocity that caught T-Bag off guard.

In the chaos, Abruzzi managed to get his hands on an old, rusted axe that had been left behind. With a primal scream, he swung the weapon, the blade connecting with T-Bag's left hand. The sickening crunch of bone and the agonized howl that followed echoed through the warehouse, but T-Bag refused to surrender.

Clutching his mangled hand, T-Bag stumbled backward, his eyes wild with a mixture of pain and rage. Scofield, ever the strategist, quickly intervened, his calm demeanor belying the turmoil within.

"Enough!" he commanded, his voice cutting through the din. "We need to work together if we're going to make it out of here alive."

Reluctantly, T-Bag and Abruzzi backed down, their animosity temporarily subdued by Scofield's unwavering resolve. The trio continued their escape, their fates now inextricably linked, each man driven by his own demons and the promise of freedom that lay just beyond their reach.
