The warehouse was a cavernous beast, its skeletal frame echoing with the distant rumble of city traffic. A place of shadows, of secrets, and now, of violence. Scofield, his mind a labyrinth of calculations and plans, moved with a predatory grace. His eyes, sharp and focused, scanned the echoing space, searching for any potential threats.

Beside him, T-Bag was a tempest, his feral energy a constant undercurrent of unpredictability. His eyes, wild and hungry, darted around like trapped animals. Abruzzi, the third figure in this deadly tableau, was a looming shadow, his bulk and the glint in his eye promising a storm.

The tension was palpable. It crackled in the air like static electricity, building, building, until it exploded. T-Bag, with a guttural roar, lunged at Abruzzi. Their bodies collided with a thunderous impact, a whirlwind of fists and grunts filling the warehouse. Scofield watched, a detached observer, his mind already calculating the potential outcomes.

The fight was brutal, a savage ballet of pain and aggression. Abruzzi, despite his size, was surprisingly agile. He ducked under T-Bag's wild swings, his counterattacks precise and deadly. But T-Bag was relentless, his ferocity a force to be reckoned with.

Then, it happened. With a savage cry, Abruzzi broke free from T-Bag's grip. From the shadows, he produced an axe. The glint of steel in the dim light was a chilling promise. With a swift, brutal motion, he swung. The axe bit deep into T-Bag's left arm, a sickening crunch echoing through the warehouse.

T-Bag screamed, a sound raw and primal. He staggered back, clutching the severed limb, his face a mask of shock and disbelief. Abruzzi stood over him, the axe dripping with crimson, his eyes cold and calculating.

Scofield watched, his expression impassive. This was not part of the plan. But plans, he knew, were often disrupted. Now, the game had changed. And he, the master strategist, would have to adapt.

T-Bag lay curled on the cold concrete floor, his left arm a throbbing, phantom pain. His breath came in ragged gasps, each inhale a sharp sting of agony. Abruzzi stood over him, his face a mask of contempt.

"Well, well," Abruzzi sneered, his voice a grating rasp. "Looks like someone got a little overzealous."

T-Bag’s voice was a hoarse croak, "You... you fucking animal."

Abruzzi laughed, a short, bitter sound. "Animal? More like a rabid dog, always snapping at the heels of others. You deserved worse."

T-Bag gritted his teeth, trying to ignore the pulsing pain. "You won’t get away with this, Abruzzi. I’ll see you dead."

Abruzzi tilted his head, a mocking smirk playing on his lips. "Is that so? And how exactly do you plan to do that, hmm? With your little stump?"

T-Bag’s eyes narrowed. "Don’t underestimate me, you bastard."

Abruzzi scoffed. "Oh, I won’t. I’ll be watching you, T-Bag. And when the time comes, I’ll finish what I started."

With that, Abruzzi turned and walked away, his footsteps echoing in the cavernous warehouse. T-Bag was left alone with his pain and his rage, a dangerous combination.
