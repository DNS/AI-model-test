Protagonist: Scofield
Antagonist 1: T-Bag
Antagonist 2: Abruzzi

Scofield, T-Bag, Abruzzi go inside a large warehouse. They are searching for something special in the store, but their journey is interrupted by a strange sound coming from behind the back of T-Bag.

T-Bag, Abruzzi and Scofield look down into the warehouse where they find something they had been searching for - a rare, ancient piece of pottery with intricate designs etching on it. They carefully remove it from the storage area and scoop it out onto the floor. It is not a piece of pottery that T-Bag has seen before.

Scofield, now armed with this precious item, approaches Abruzzi who was hiding behind him earlier to ask about what they had been searching for. Abruzzi explains that he found it in his study while studying ancient artifacts on Earth.

T-Bag and Scofield go over the pottery in awe of its beauty. They decide to take it back home as a reminder of their search for knowledge and experience valuable items of art in their world.

Scofield, now with the piece of pottery, brings it back inside the warehouse to his new friend Abruzzi. Together they discuss their journey of discovery and what they have found that will help them advance further on their paths of exploration and knowledge.

As they return home from exploring the world, Scofield, T-Bag and Abruzzi decide to set up a booth at local markets where people can come across pieces of pottery like this one. They then leave for their next adventure as they continue to discover new treasures, experience different worlds, and continue to push their limits of knowledge.

T-Bag returns home with the piece of pottery, and Scofield, Abruzzi and T-Bag start a business selling unique pieces of pottery from all over the world at events such as these markets. They also find that they can meet other artists who have been looking for similar items.

Scofield, now known to the world as Scofield Pottery, grows in popularity as his pottery is discovered by new and old faces alike. He continues to expand his collection, selling it all over Europe, Asia, Africa and beyond.

Abruzzi finds that with Scofield's unique pottery he can do much more than just sell them on the streets of Europe. He starts using Scofield Pottery in his studies, teaching himself about ancient artistry. Abruzzi also travels to places like Egypt where Scofield is able to showcase pieces of their pottery.

Scofield and Abruzzi live happily ever after, continuing to explore new worlds and create new treasures from them together as they discover the world around them.
