 Scofield, T-Bag, and Abruzzi found themselves in an abandoned warehouse, the air thick with tension and mistrust. None of them had come there by choice, but rather by circumstance, each with their own agenda and secrets.

T-Bag, a cunning and ruthless inmate, had always been a thorn in Scofield's side. He had a way of manipulating and twisting situations to his advantage, leaving a trail of chaos and destruction in his wake.

Abruzzi, on the other hand, was a powerful and feared mob boss, with a reputation for violence and a thirst for power. He had his own reasons for being in the warehouse, and they had nothing to do with Scofield or T-Bag.

As they moved deeper into the warehouse, T-Bag and Abruzzi's paths crossed, and a violent altercation ensued. The two men fought fiercely, their fists and feet flying as they battled for dominance.

In the heat of the fight, Abruzzi grabbed an axe that was lying nearby and swung it at T-Bag with all his might. The blade sliced through the air, and with a sickening thud, it connected with T-Bag's left hand, severing it from his arm.

But T-Bag was not so easily defeated. He let out a blood-curdling scream, his face contorted in pain and rage. He clutched his bleeding stump with his right hand, his eyes wild with fury.

Despite his injury, T-Bag refused to back down. He lunged at Abruzzi, his teeth bared and his eyes blazing with a fierce determination. Abruzzi, taken aback by T-Bag's tenacity, stumbled backwards, tripping over a pile of debris and falling to the ground.

T-Bag loomed over him, his face twisted in a grotesque smile as he raised his bloody stump in the air, ready to deliver the final blow.

But just as he was about to strike, Scofield intervened. He grabbed T-Bag from behind, pinning his arms to his sides and preventing him from attacking Abruzzi.

T-Bag struggled and cursed, but Scofield held him firm. He knew that T-Bag was a dangerous and unpredictable man, and he couldn't risk letting him loose.

As Scofield wrestled with T-Bag, Abruzzi slowly got to his feet, his eyes fixed on the two men. He knew that he had to get out of there, and fast.

He picked up his things and made his way to the door, his heart pounding in his chest. He didn't look back, didn't dare to breathe until he was safely outside.

As he walked away, he couldn't help but feel a sense of relief. He had survived the encounter with T-Bag, but he knew that it was only a matter of time before their paths crossed again.

And when they did, he would be ready.

As for Scofield and T-Bag, they were left alone in the warehouse, their fates intertwined in a complex web of secrets and lies.

But that is a story for another time.
